# Notes

## Self hosting

### tiiny.host

[tiiny.host](https://tiiny.hosts) is really well done and very simple to use, but injects `javascript` code rather than a _simple_ banner.

even if the latter can be removed with a bit of code (`document.body.fisrtChild.style.display = "None"` for example), the problem remains (eg. what does the injected javascript do ?).
