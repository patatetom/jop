have an HTML5 file that integrates everything needed for display (CSS) and password generation (JS)

- the page (eg. the file) must be _responsive_ : the smartphone is the main target (having your generator with you)
- the application (eg. the page) must be _user friendly_ : pretty, efficient (pre-positioned cursor, for example)
- the _form_ used to enter the service must store it in memory (see exportation for synchronization)
- _security_ must of course be considered : hidden secret, grayed-out password, automatic deletion, etc...
- the page should be modifiable according to the _language_ defined on the browser
- the page should have _integrated help_
